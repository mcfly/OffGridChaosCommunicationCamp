# OffGridChaosCommunicationCamp

Unity level modded after the Chaos Communication camp 2019. 
So far you will mostly see milliways in here but the goal is to have at some point the whole Chaos Communication Camp in here.

This is clearly still heavily work in progress and cannot be used for any production use here. Like at all. We'll write it when that changes.

If you want to contribute and add your village from the cccamp2019 please join the discord and talk to us. 

Documentation can be found on the wiki and might be slightly outdated as there is quite some work in progress. 
Therefore read more about it on the wiki http://wiki.offgridthegame.com/index.php?title=Milliways_CCCamp_mod

If you want to stay in contact follow @OffGridTheGame @Semaeopus @richmetson and me (@mcflyhh) on twitter.

Further information can be found on the wiki - mentioned above - and on the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS7dAS0ZyLvdG7zK7rUlweA
