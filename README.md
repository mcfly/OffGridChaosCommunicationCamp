# OffGridChaosCommunicationCamp

Unity level modded after the Chaos Communication camp 2019 and 2023.

This mod is an amalgamation, a dream, the ideals of camp, everything you could imagine, it is CCCamp for every year and any year. Add yourself, your memories, people you met there, people you wish had been able to make it. 

So far you will mostly see Milliways, C-base, and Geraffel in here but the goal is to have at some point the whole Chaos Communication Camp represented.

This is clearly still heavily work in progress and cannot be used for any production use here. Like at all. We'll write it when that changes.

If you want to contribute and add your village from the cccamp2019 cccamp2023, ...or previous, ... or beyond please join the discord  (https://discord.com/invite/semaeopus) and talk to us (@mc.fly). 

Documentation can be found on the wiki and might be slightly outdated as there is quite some work in progress. 
Therefore read more about it on the wiki http://wiki.offgridthegame.com/index.php?title=Milliways_CCCamp_mod
